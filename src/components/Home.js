      Welcome. I'm glad you stopped by. I am an experienced psychotherapist in
      Manhattan, providing a warm and safe environment where you will be allowed
      to be vulnerable without feeling judged. Maybe you're depressed, anxious,
      or feeling stuck. Or maybe you want to improve your relationships, manage
      daily stress, change negative thought patterns, or heal from trauma,
      emotional wounds, or loss. Therapy can help. I offer both brief and long
      term treatment for individuals and couples ages 18 and older.
