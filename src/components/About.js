      I am a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst with many years of
      experience treating adults, adolescents and children. While I utilize a
      wide range of current treatment techniques, my practice is based on a
      foundation of contemporary psychoanalytic approaches. I have found a
      psychodynamic perspective—the view that our emotional lives represent a
      continually evolving process that determines our lived experience in
      meaningful and purposive ways—to be essential for understanding a whole
      person and their current life situation. Because each of us expresses
      ourselves in unique ways, thoughts, feelings, behaviors and symptoms can
      be understood only through our lived experience of them. You are the only
      expert when it comes to your own experience; my role, simply put, is to
      assist you in experiencing more of yourself and the life around you.
